## Basic concepts

### Molecular scaffolds

### Ligands activity measures

* **IC50** - half maximal inhibitory concentration [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50)
  *  **pIC50** = -log(IC50)
* **EC50** - half maximal effective concentration
* **LD50**  - median lethal dose
* **Ki** - binding affinity - describes the interaction of most ligands with their binding sites; high-affinity ligand binding results from greater intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity ligand binding involves less intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor. In general, high-affinity binding involves a longer residence time for the ligand at its receptor binding site than is the case for low-affinity binding. 

The median affinity (IC50, EC50, ED50, Ki, Kd) for current small-molecule drugs is around **20 nM** (source: doi:10.1038/nrd2199)


# Software

## Drawing and visualizing small molecules

MarvinSketch from MarvinBeans Suite. Download for free (after registration): https://www.chemaxon.com/download/marvin-suite/#mbeans

:thought_balloon: **Practicals:**
- Draw the LSD molecule
- Save it as smiles, mol2, sdf
- copy it to clipboard as smiles and paste to the notepad
- optimize the 3D structure


## Molecule formats and formats conversion

- http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page
- http://openbabel.org/docs/current/Command-line_tools/babel.html

:thought_balloon: **Practicals:**
- convert saved molecules to sdf, mol2 and PDB
- add hydrogens
- optimize 3D structure
- generate conformers
