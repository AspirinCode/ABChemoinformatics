## Basic concepts

### Molecular scaffolds

![scaffolds](data/scaffolds.png)

### Ligands activity measures

* **IC50** - half maximal inhibitory concentration [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50)
  *  **pIC50** = -log(IC50)
* **EC50** - half maximal effective concentration
* **LD50**  - median lethal dose
* **Ki** - binding affinity - describes the interaction of most ligands with their binding sites; high-affinity ligand binding results from greater intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity ligand binding involves less intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor. In general, high-affinity binding involves a longer residence time for the ligand at its receptor binding site than is the case for low-affinity binding. 

The median affinity (IC50, EC50, ED50, Ki, Kd) for current small-molecule drugs is around **20 nM** (source: doi:10.1038/nrd2199)


# Software

## Drawing and visualizing small molecules

MarvinSketch from MarvinBeans Suite. Download for free (after registration): https://www.chemaxon.com/download/marvin-suite/#mbeans

:zap: **Practicals:**

:zap: **Practicals:**

- From the ChemBlDb, download IC50 activity for JAK2 Kinase
- prepare a workflow:
 - Read the data from CSV file
 - convert smiles string to structures
 - calculate moelcular descriptors: AMW, logP, TPSA
 - calculate logBB according to the formlula: ![formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filipsPL/CADD-PW/master/KNIME/JAK/BBB.png) (:bulb: use Math Node)
 - calculate the pareto rank, minimizing IC50 value, MW, logP and TPSA

- For these data:
 - Create a 3D plot:
 - xyz: TPSA / logP / AMW
 - color by: IC50
 - points size: logBB
 - save as png
- play with another types of plot (parallel coordinates, bar plots, conditional bar plots etc)
- sort the table according to Pareto Ran value (ascending)
- save 10 top ranking compounds to csv and xls files.

## Git

Git (/…°…™t/) is a version control system that is widely used for software development and other version control tasks. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[9] Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
